### Other Information
I also personaly utilize Blue Iris for my NVR but send a 30 second clip to Home Assistant for review in a card after it converted to mp4. I will review how I handle disk space with automations in Home Assistant to maintain the desik space on the Home Assistant VM.

Additionally I utilize Emby for home home media server, and will review how to show what is playing on what device as well as the latest downloaded movies.
