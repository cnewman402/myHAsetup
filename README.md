### Additional Information
I utilize Blue Iris for my NVR and send a 30 second clip to Home Assistant for review in a card after it convertes to mp4. 
I will review how I handle disk space with automations in Home Assistant to maintain the disk space on the Home Assistant VM.
I utilize Emby for my home media server, and will review how to show what is playing on what device as well as the latest downloaded movies.
